Your task is to take the  k
 -means code here and see what happens when you change the value of  k
 What solution, if any, do you find most compelling? 
 
 Does complexity start to become an issue with this data set? 
 Play around a bit and write up your findings and your process to share with your mentor. 
 Keep in mind that it may be possible to have a solution with more than two clusters that is still 
 better at tracking the real binary outcome â€“ two of those clusters may map to "heart disease" while
 the other maps to "no heart disease," for example.
 
 I found that the more clusters that were created, specifically more than 2 the clusters, then the clusters are not creating a
 separate structure in space.
