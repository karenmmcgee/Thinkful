Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. 
We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? 
What aspects of KNN would be useful? 
Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

The 4 main categories would be the x features used to determine the response/predicted variable y (people that will pay on time)
Therefore, to use KNN the X features would be my distinct data points. I would calculate z-scores for each observation to 
normalized the dataset. I would also add weight to the KNN classifier since the data isn't exactly similar. Then I would 
write a function to see if i could determine the best value to use for K.
