You've seen how these three methods work on three blobs of reasonably separated data. Now go back and change the data. 
Create more or fewer blobs, and set the blobs closer together or farther apart. 
Set up at least three different blob configuations, then run the four methods ( k
 -means, mean shift, spectral clustering and affinity propagation) on each one. 
 Write up a report for your mentor where you discuss what you learned about the clustering methods based on their 
 relative performance for your different blob setups.
 
 Mean shift: Origianl started with quantile of 0.3 and sample size of 500
            Change the quantile to 0.5 and sample size to 1000. 
 Result = 1 cluster
             Change the quantile to 0.1 keep sample size at 1000
 Result = 4 cluster
             Change the quantile to 0.3 keep sample size at 1000
 Result = 3 cluster
 
 Conclusion: it appears that as the quantile number increase the number of clusters also increase
 
 Spatial clustering: Origianlly started with 5 clusters

            Change the number of cluster to 10
            
 Result =  
 col_0    0   1    2    3    4    5  6   7   8    9

0        0   0  128    0    2    0  0   0  93  139
1       19  11    1  179    0  106  4   0   0    0
2      136   0   23    2  130    1  0  26   0    0

Conclusion: increasing the number of clusters is not giving a wide distance between all of the clusters.
